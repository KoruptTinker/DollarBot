# Enhanced Data Visualization

## Overview
The Enhanced Data Visualization feature provides users with a range of interactive and customizable charting options to better analyze and understand their spending patterns. This feature expands on the existing graphing functionalities by adding more chart types, such as bar and pie charts, and allows users to filter data by specific categories or timeframes for more detailed insights.

## Feature Details
- **Diverse Chart Types**: Includes bar charts, pie charts, and line charts, enabling users to visualize spending patterns in various formats.
- **Category and Time Filters**: Allows users to filter data by category (e.g., food, utilities) or by time (weekly, monthly), offering more tailored insights into spending.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can select specific visualization options directly within the interface, enabling a more user-friendly experience.

## Benefits
- **Improved Insights**: Users can view spending patterns in a way that aligns with their personal preferences and goals.
- **Customizable Views**: Tailoring visualizations to specific categories or periods provides users with more relevant and actionable insights.
- **Enhanced Financial Awareness**: Visual summaries of spending promote mindfulness and help users identify areas to adjust spending.

## Usage Examples

1. **View Weekly Spending**  
   - To view a weekly summary of spending across categories, users can input the command: `/weekly chart <category>`
   - For instance, to view a weekly chart of food expenses, users would enter: `/weekly chart food`

2. **View Monthly Spending**  
   - Users can view a monthly summary with the command: `/monthly chart <category>`
   - Example: To view the monthly summary of transportation expenses: `/monthly chart transportation`

3. **Customizable Visualizations by Category and Time**  
   - Users can customize views to analyze specific trends in their spending by using filters like `food`, `utilities`, and `transportation`.
   - Example commands:
     - `/weekly chart utilities` — to view the weekly spending on utilities.
     - `/monthly chart entertainment` — to view the monthly spending on entertainment.
